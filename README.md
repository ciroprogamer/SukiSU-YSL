not official implementation of SUkiSu ultra to Xiaomi ysl(Redmi S2, Redmi Y2)

cant belive finishing this took a month, well, makes sense since i didnt even knew C
anyways, to build it, you can just use kernel_build_fixed.sh script


it should work, or maybe not, it works for me, except the damn LSPosed for some reason

there are a bunch of useless files in some folders, ignore it

backup your whole soul before using anything made by me.

kpm doesnt work without patch, and i havent tested it, who cares, modules and root should work

also, good luck.
