**UNOFFICIAL PORT**  
This is **NOT an official implementation of SukiSU Ultra or KernelSU**.  
It is **not supported or endorsed** by the KernelSU/SukiSU developers.

I can't believe this took a month to finish —  
but yeah, that makes sense since I didn’t even know C.

## Device
- Xiaomi Redmi S2 / Redmi Y2 (`ysl`)

## Build
To build the kernel, just run:
```bash
./kernel_build_fixed.sh

Does it work?

Yes.
Also no.
It works for me, BUT backup your boot partition(and soul) before using anything I make.

##Status

Root & modules:  working(As far as I tested)

LSPosed:  refuses to cooperate and device gets stuck on Redmi boot splash (don’t ask me why)

KPM:  doesn’t work without patches (untested, don’t care enough)
